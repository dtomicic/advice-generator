## Project task
This project is part of Frontend Mentors course. The goal of this project was to display advice using Advice Slip API and generate a new advice on every refresh or click of a button.

## Project overview
I picked this project out so I could get more familliar with JavaScript and working with APIs. The project seemed like a good intro project into working with API and getting more comfortable with JavaScript. The design itself is nothing complex a simple HTML and CSS card centered on the page. Got introduced to fetching API, parsing it into JSON format and then displaying it on page with already styled classes.

## Built with
- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript
